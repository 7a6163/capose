# Capose - A capistrano addon to use with docker-compose

This gem is a lighter version of https://github.com/netguru/capistrano-docker that aims to work only with docker-compose. The idea is to have a minimal possible capistrano configuration and use the power of docker-compose to build images and run containers.
